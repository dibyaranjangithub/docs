The Contributor License Agreement \(CLA\) service of the Linux Foundation lets project contributors read, sign, and submit contributor license agreements easily.

This repository contains both the backend and front-end UI for supporting and managing the application.

This platform supports both GitHub and Gerrit source code repositories. Additional information can be found in the [Getting Started ](getting-started/)section of this document.

## CLA Backend <a id="cla-backend"></a>

The CLA project has two backend projects.

The majority of the backend APIs are implemented in python, and can be found in the [`cla-backend`](https://github.com/communitybridge/easycla/tree/master/cla-backend) directory.

Recent backend development was implemented in Golang, and can be found in the [`cla-backend-go`](https://github.com/communitybridge/easycla/tree/master/cla-backend-go) directory. In particular, this backend contains APIs powering Automated Templates, GitHub Approved List of contributors, and Duplicate Company handling in the Corporate Console.
